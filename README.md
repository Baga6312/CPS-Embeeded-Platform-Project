# Description : 
- This IoT-based energy monitor uses an **Arduino Mega 2560** paired with its **Wi-Fi shield** to track real-time power consumption of household appliances. A **non-invasive SCT-013 current clamp** safely measures electrical current without direct wiring, while a **TFT display** shows live readings. Data is sent to the cloud (ThingSpeak) for remote monitoring, allowing users to analyze energy usage and optimize costs. Perfect for college projects, it combines IoT connectivity, sensor integration, and practical applications in a simple, safe, and visual package.²
- **What it does**:
	1. Clamp the sensor around a wire → measures current.
	2. Displays **current (A)** and **power (W)** on the screen.
	3. Sends data to **ThingSpeak** for remote monitoring.
